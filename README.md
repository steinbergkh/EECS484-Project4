###Getting started on Project 4 - Piazza Note
Given the feedback in office hour and Piazza, here're a couple of notes for project 4.

Project 4 is supposed to be a little bit more challenging compared to the previous ones, especially if you plan to do the extra credit. So don't be frustrated if you can't get it straight/can't figure out what to do after reading through spec and given code completely once or twice.

A couple of helpful notes to get you started:
1. buffer at least an hour or two to sit down and read the spec & code given
2. read through and understand what's in each file
3. try to see how is each struct defined is linked to one another
4. conceptually understand how each algorithm work before you implement them
5. figure out a (pseudocode) plan for how to implement each function, and then just look up the struct/class/function interfaces you need. If you start writing code without a plan, it's likely that you'll start to look for information when you don't know what exactly you're looking for, and then you'll probably be lost.

All the information you need is defined and given in the code. The spec covers all the project requirements, but may not explain every piece of code you need to know and may not be organized in your favorite way. But if you spend some time trying to understand how each class/file is organized, it shouldn't be hard to find the functions you need for your implementation.
